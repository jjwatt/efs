* Trying this out
Here I'm just trying to get started with this new config using
emacs24-starter kit literate programming style.  I'm a little confused
already because my normal keybindings aren't working. Ah, apparently
org is freaking out. Let's see what version of org my emacs is using.

Yep, it's not being loaded right.  I think I want to try out cask, but
I'm not sure if it will conflict with starter kit.  For now, I'm just
going to install org under src and restart emacs.  Just to make sure
it gets loaded, for now, I'll define ORG_HOME inside init.el. I'll git
clone the latest version into =.emacs.d/src/org-mode= and point
ORG_HOME there.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git $HOME/.emacs.d/src/org-mode
#+END_SRC

You should at least =make autoloads= in org-mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.emacs.d/src/org-mode
make autoloads
#+END_SRC

You can point org-mode's make at a different emacs with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make EMACS=~/local/bin/emacs-latest autoloads
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar my-home (getenv "HOME"))
(defvar my-src (expand-file-name "src" my-home))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setenv "ORG_HOME" (expand-file-name ".emacs.d/src/org-mode" my-home))
(defvar my-org-home (getenv "ORG_HOME"))
#+END_SRC

* Does org-mode work better now?
It looks like org-mode might be working better now. Yes, the enter key
does what I expect, and auto-fill is working.

* Packages
I'm not sure if the starter-kit is supposed to install packages
automatically, but it keeps erroring here and there after I add more
of the starter kit below. It's annoying to constantly have to
package-install after you see it fail, so let's just use cask.
  - [[http://cask.github.io/][Cask Website]]

** Cask
Cask is a package manager for emacs. It uses the elpa package
management in the background, but makes things like dependency
management, package sourcing, switching things around, and even
package building and development a little easier. This should get us
set up.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/cask/cask.git $HOME/src/cask
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export PATH="$HOME/src/cask/bin:$PATH"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd $HOME/.emacs.d/
cask init
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'cask (expand-file-name "cask/cask.el" my-src))
(cask-initialize)
#+END_SRC

** Using Cask
Run cask install to install dependencies.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cask install
#+END_SRC

*** Cask with Other Emacs
If you're like me and you build your own emacs from source or you have
different emacs installed in different locations (besides
=/usr/bin/emacs=), and especially if you go back and forth between
different versions sometimes, you might notice that cask isn't
installing packages for that particular version of emacs. It will use
the default 'emacs' binary in your PATH. I looked at the cask binary,
and it's a Python script. Luckily, I didn't have to hack it because
cask *does* look at the EMACS environment variable to pick an emacs to
use before settling on the one in your PATH. Just set EMACS to the
binary path of your desired version of emacs. For me, it's in
=~/local/bin/emacs-latest=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export EMACS=$HOME/local/bin/emacs-latest
cask install
#+END_SRC

You should probably set this in your .bashrc or .zshrc, too. Here,
I'll set it in my emacs config.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setenv "EMACS" (expand-file-name "local/bin/emacs-latest" my-home))
#+END_SRC

* Load more of starter-kit
** Python
I don't like the python-mode in starter kit. See below where I do my
own Python initialization.
** Eshell
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (starter-kit-load "eshell")
 #+END_SRC

** Lisp
This should load elisp, scheme, cl, and clojure stuff.
At least, according to [[file:starter-kit-lisp.org][starter-kit-lisp.org]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(starter-kit-load "lisp")
#+END_SRC

** Javascript
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(starter-kit-load "js")
#+END_SRC
** Misc-recommended
Let's see what this is like.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(starter-kit-load "misc-recommended")
#+END_SRC
* Python
** Basic Python Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'python)

  ;; setup completion, etc. for IPython
  (setq
   python-shell-interpreter "ipython"
   python-shell-interpreter-args ""
   python-shell-prompt-regexp "In \\[[0-9]+\\]: "
   python-shell-prompt-output-regexp "Out\\[[0-9]+\\]: "
   python-shell-completion-setup-code
     "from IPython.core.completerlib import module_completion"
   python-shell-completion-module-string-code
     "';'.join(module_completion('''%s'''))\n"
   python-shell-completion-string-code
     "';'.join(get_ipython().Completer.all_completions('''%s'''))\n")

  (setq python-skeleton-autoinsert t)
  ;; TODO: Use a different directory for pydoc-info?
  ;; TODO: Only run this if pydoc-info is installed
  ;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/subs/pydoc-info"))
  ;; (require 'pydoc-info)
  ;; (info-lookup-add-help
  ;;    :mode 'python-mode
  ;;    :parse-rule 'pydoc-info-python-symbol-at-point
  ;;    :doc-spec
  ;;    '(("(python)Index" pydoc-info-lookup-transform-entry)
  ;;      ("(TARGETNAME)Index" pydoc-info-lookup-transform-entry)))
#+END_SRC

* Org-mode
Arguably the most important for me. In my previous config, I
autoloaded files from an init.d directory under my .emacs.d. I'll just
start ripping pieces out of my org.el and making them work here. It
will be a lot more organized than my current org.el.  Let's get
started.

** Load Path
I should already have org-mode loaded by the starterkit and my
ORG_HOME, so I shouldn't need to add it to my load path anymore. I
want to make sure the contrib directory for org-mode is in my load
path, though. I'll setup the mode-alist here, too (and possibly other
top-level stuff later).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "contrib/lisp" my-org-home))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.\\(org\\|org_archive\\|txt\\)$" . org-mode))
  ;; this probably isn't needed with the starter-kit
  (require 'org)
#+END_SRC

** Global Org Keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+END_SRC

** Local Org Keys
I'm leaving this commented for now because I haven't pulled in
org-pomodoro yet.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (local-set-key "\C-co" 'org-pomodoro)
#+END_SRC

** Org Directories and Special Files
I use =~/org= as my base. I also have an =~/org/personal= directory
that is encrypted, but it gets dynamically loaded in special agenda
views which you can see later on.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory "~/org")
  (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
  (setq org-default-ideas-file (concat org-directory "/ideas.org"))
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org"))
  (setq org-refile-targets '((nil :maxlevel . 2)
                             (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 1)))
#+END_SRC

** Other Org Settings Variables
I won't explain each setting variable right now, but I'll try to group
them all here.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-log-done 'time)
    (setq org-refile-use-outline-path 'file)
    (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes 'confirm)
    (setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
    (setq org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies t)
  (setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks t)
  
  ; Targets complete directly with IDO
  (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil)
  
  ; Use IDO for both buffer and file completion and ido-everywhere to t
  (setq org-completion-use-ido t)
  (setq ido-everywhere t)
  (setq ido-max-directory-size 100000)
  (ido-mode (quote both))
  
  ; Use the current window when visiting files and buffers with ido
  (setq ido-default-file-method 'selected-window)
  (setq ido-default-buffer-method 'selected-window)
  
  ;; remember clocking between sessions
  (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
  (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
  
  ;; logbook drawer and clocking
  (setq org-log-into-drawer t)
  (setq org-clock-into-drawer t)
  
  ;; archive setup
  (setq org-archive-mark-done nil)
  (setq org-archive-location "%s_archive::* Archived Tasks")
  
  ;; preserve indentation for babel (makefiles)
  (setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
#+END_SRC

** Org Hooks
If you didn't know, emacs loves hooks (as most interactive and
programmable software should). You can add hooks for
different modes that enable other modes, set variables, or do anything
at all really. Here is where I setup some hooks for org-modes.

I like abbrev-mode. honestly, I haven't been using auto-fill mode
lately. I'll comment it out for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (abbrev-mode t)))
  ;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
  ;; (add-hook 'org-capture-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Org Tasks
These can be overrided or appended per-file. But, these are my default
tasks types.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ; Setup Tasks
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        (quote (
        (type "NOTE(N)" "IDEA(i)" "|" "DISMISSED")
        (sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d)")
        (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "HOLD(h@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)" "PHONE")
        )))
  (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
        (quote (("TODO" :foreground "red" :weight bold)
                ("NEXT" :foreground "blue" :weight bold)
                ("DONE" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
                ("WAITING" :foreground "orange" :weight bold)
                ("HOLD" :foreground "magenta" :weight bold)
                ("CANCELLED" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
                ("PHONE" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
                ("NOTE" :foreground "dark slate blue" :weight bold)
                ("IDEA" :foreground "yellow1" :weight bold))))
#+END_SRC
** Capture Templates
These are for quickly capturing stuff from any buffer in emacs. These
are awesome. If you use org-mode, but have never used the capture-mode
stuff, try it out! Mine is fairly basic right now. Notes, Ideas,
Todos, and I added Work Journal and Journal entries because I use
separate journal.org files for writing longer journal-like entries.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; capture templates
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" entry (file org-default-notes-file)
        "* TODO %?\n%U\n%a\n" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("n" "Note" entry (file org-default-notes-file)
         "* NOTE %? %^G\n%U\n  %i\n  %a\n")
        ("i" "Idea" entry (file org-default-ideas-file)
         "* IDEA %?\n%U\n%a\n" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("J" "Work Journal" entry
         (file+datetree (concat org-directory "/journal.org"))
         "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
        ("j" "Personal Journal" entry
         (file+datetree (concat org-directory "/personal/journal.org"))
         "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
        ("x" "X selection" entry (file org-default-notes-file)
         "* %? \n%U\n  %i\n  %x\n")))
#+END_SRC

** Agendas
I like most of the default agenda commands, but since I want to keep
separate agendas for work and personal stuff, I just use hooks to bind
resetting the =org-agenda-files= variable before building my
agendas. Yes, I love you org-mode, I love you lisp, and I love you
emacs.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("P" "Personal agenda"
         agenda "Personal" ((org-agenda-files '("~/org/personal"))))
        ("A" "Agenda for everything"
          agenda "Everything"
          ((org-agenda-files '("~/org" "~/org/personal"))))))
#+END_SRC

** Babel
Here are a few config items for Babel, code blocks and literate
programming. I'm sure this section will get bigger as I'm getting
really into LP lately. It's one reason why I'm getting down with this
emacs24-starter-kit joint.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; stuff for code blocks
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
  (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)

  ;; load languages with babel
  (custom-set-variables
   '(org-babel-load-languages (quote ((emacs-lisp . t)
                                      (R . t)
                                      (python . t)
                                      (sh . t)
                                      (makefile . t))))

** Custom Org Functions
*** Org Archiving
I stole this from (TODO: insert ref). He has a great setup, and his
literate org guide is an excellent way to get started with org-mode.

*** Publishing
TODO: I'm leaving out my publishing functions for now because they
have a lot of content-specific stuff and project names that I'd rather
not reveal. I'll figure out a way to include some of the generic
publishing functions later, and I keep meaning to dabble with
org-encrypt functions at some point, anyway.
*** Pomodoro
TODO: Leaving Pomodoro functions out for now. I need to pull in those dependencies.

Some better defaults. I'm not sure if starter-kit loads these or not yet.

* Themes
Add our themes directories that are outside of starter-kit, and may be

I'll start adding git submodules here, too.

I'm using solarized more than base16 again lately. Add this to your Cask:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

#+END_SRC

Or run =M-x= =package-install= =solarized-theme=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

Try the base16 themes with =M-x= =load-theme= =base16-default=, etc.
