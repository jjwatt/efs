* Trying this out
Here I'm just trying to get started with this new config using emacs24-starter kit literate programming style.
I'm a little confused already because my normal keybindings aren't working. Ah, apparently org is freaking out. Let's see what version of org my emacs is using.

Yep, it's not being loaded right.
I think I want to try out cask, but I'm not sure if it will conflict with starter kit.
For now, I'm just going to install org under src and restart emacs.
Just to make sure it gets loaded, for now, I'll define ORG_HOME inside init.el

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setenv "ORG_HOME" "/home/wattenbarger/.emacs.d/src/org-mode")
#+END_SRC
