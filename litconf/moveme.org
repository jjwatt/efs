#+TITLE: Test Out new config
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil ^:nil

* Doing it
- Just a few things to get started and make sure that this works.

- Add litconfig directory to load-path
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path litconfig-dir)
(load-theme 'wombat)
#+END_SRC

* Customization File
Emacs normally just appends the custom variables lisp to the end of
=init.el=. I'd rather keep it in a separate file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" "~/.emacs.d"))
#+END_SRC

* Cask
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'cask (expand-file-name "cask/cask.el" "~/.emacs.d"))
(cask-initialize)
#+END_SRC

* Start Kit Functions
I'm grabbing some functions from starter kit in case I wan to load
parts of the starter kit. Although, once I finish with my config, I
don't imagine I will.

** Starter Kit Dependencies
- Ubiquitous Packages which should be loaded on startup rather than
  autoloaded on demand since they are likely to be used in every
  session.
  #+name: starter-kit-load-on-startup
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl)
    (require 'saveplace)
    (require 'ffap)
    (require 'uniquify)

    (require 'recentf)
  #+end_src

- Functions for loading other parts of the starter kit

    (defun starter-kit-load (file &optional header-or-tag)
      "Load configuration from other starter-kit-*.org files.
    If the optional argument is the id of a subtree then only
    configuration from within that subtree will be loaded.  If it is
    not an id then it will be interpreted as a tag, and only subtrees
    marked with the given tag will be loaded.
    
    For example, to load all of starter-kit-lisp.org simply
    add (starter-kit-load \"lisp\") to your configuration.

    starter-kit-misc-recommended.org add

* Key Bindings
It might be nice to try to group all key binding settings in this
section. For now, it will at least contain general keybindings, and
some more specific keybindings might still exist closer to their
application.

** Completion and Expansion
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(global-set-key (kbd "M-/") 'hippie-expand)
#+end_src

** Turn on the menu bar for exploring new modes

* Org-mode
Arguably the most important for me. In my previous config, I
autoloaded files from an init.d directory under my .emacs.d. I'll just
start ripping pieces out of my org.el and making them work here. It
will be a lot more organized than my current org.el.  Let's get
started.

** Load Path
I should already have org-mode loaded by the starterkit and my
ORG_HOME, so I shouldn't need to add it to my load path anymore. I
want to make sure the contrib directory for org-mode is in my load
path, though. I'll setup the mode-alist here, too (and possibly other
top-level stuff later).


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.\\(org\\|org_archive\\|txt\\)$" . org-mode))
;; this probably isn't needed with the starter-kit
(setq  org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file t)
(require 'org)
#+END_SRC

** Global Org Keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+END_SRC

** Local Org Keys
I'm leaving this commented for now because I haven't pulled in
org-pomodoro yet.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (local-set-key "\C-co" 'org-pomodoro)
#+END_SRC

** Org Directories and Special Files
I use =~/org= as my base. I also have an =~/org/personal= directory
that is encrypted, but it gets dynamically loaded in special agenda
views which you can see later on.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory "~/org")
  (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
  (setq org-default-ideas-file (concat org-directory "/ideas.org"))
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org"))
  (setq org-refile-targets '((nil :maxlevel . 2)
                             (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 1)))
#+END_SRC

** Other Org Settings Variables
I won't explain each setting variable right now, but I'll try to group
them all here.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-log-done 'time)
    (setq org-refile-use-outline-path 'file)
    (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes 'confirm)
    (setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
    (setq org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies t)
  (setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks t)

  ; Targets complete directly with IDO
  (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil)

  ; Use IDO for both buffer and file completion and ido-everywhere to t
  (setq org-completion-use-ido t)
  (setq ido-everywhere t)
  (setq ido-max-directory-size 100000)
  (ido-mode (quote both))

  ; Use the current window when visiting files and buffers with ido
  (setq ido-default-file-method 'selected-window)
  (setq ido-default-buffer-method 'selected-window)

  ;; remember clocking between sessions
  (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
  (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)

  ;; logbook drawer and clocking
  (setq org-log-into-drawer t)
  (setq org-clock-into-drawer t)

  ;; archive setup
  (setq org-archive-mark-done nil)
  (setq org-archive-location "%s_archive::* Archived Tasks")

  ;; preserve indentation for babel (makefiles)
  (setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
#+END_SRC

** Org Hooks
If you didn't know, emacs loves hooks (as most interactive and
programmable software should). You can add hooks for
different modes that enable other modes, set variables, or do anything
at all really. Here is where I setup some hooks for org-modes.

I like abbrev-mode. honestly, I haven't been using auto-fill mode
lately. I'll comment it out for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (abbrev-mode t)))
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (remove-hook 'before-save-hook 'whitespace-cleanup)))
  ;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
  ;; (add-hook 'org-capture-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Org Tasks
These can be overrided or appended per-file. But, these are my default
tasks types.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ; Setup Tasks
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        (quote (
        (type "NOTE(N)" "IDEA(i)" "|" "DISMISSED")
        (sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d)")
        (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "HOLD(h@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)" "PHONE")
        )))
  (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
        (quote (("TODO" :foreground "tomato" :weight bold)
                ("NEXT" :foreground "wheat" :weight bold)
                ("DONE" :foreground "spring green" :weight bold)
                ("WAITING" :foreground "orange" :weight bold)
                ("HOLD" :foreground "magenta" :weight bold)
                ("CANCELLED" :foreground "dim gray" :weight bold)
                ("PHONE" :foreground "orchid" :weight bold)
                ("NOTE" :foreground "dark turquoise" :weight bold)
                ("IDEA" :foreground "yellow1" :weight bold))))
#+END_SRC
** Capture Templates
These are for quickly capturing stuff from any buffer in emacs. These
are awesome. If you use org-mode, but have never used the capture-mode
stuff, try it out! Mine is fairly basic right now. Notes, Ideas,
Todos, and I added Work Journal and Journal entries because I use
separate journal.org files for writing longer journal-like entries.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; capture templates
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" entry (file org-default-notes-file)
        "* TODO %?\n%U\n%a\n" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("n" "Note" entry (file org-default-notes-file)
         "* NOTE %? %^G\n%U\n  %i\n  %a\n")
        ("i" "Idea" entry (file org-default-ideas-file)
         "* IDEA %?\n%U\n%a\n" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("J" "Work Journal" entry
         (file+datetree (concat org-directory "/journal.org"))
         "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
        ("j" "Personal Journal" entry
         (file+datetree (concat org-directory "/personal/journal.org"))
         "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
        ("x" "X selection" entry (file org-default-notes-file)
         "* %? \n%U\n  %i\n  %x\n")))
#+END_SRC

** Agendas
I like most of the default agenda commands, but since I want to keep
separate agendas for work and personal stuff, I just use hooks to bind
resetting the =org-agenda-files= variable before building my
agendas. Yes, I love you org-mode, I love you lisp, and I love you
emacs.

Define Agenda Files. By default, I use all files ending in =.org= and
=.org.gpg=. The default place for my agenda files is the same as my
org-directory. So any files that match this regexp in there will be
considered for the agenda views.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-file-regexp "\\`[^.].*\\.org\\(\\.gpg\\)?\\'")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("P" "Personal agenda"
         agenda "Personal" ((org-agenda-files '("~/org/personal"))
                            ))
        ("A" "Agenda for everything"
          agenda "Everything"
          ((org-agenda-files '("~/org" "~/org/personal"))
           ))))
#+END_SRC

** Babel
Here are a few config items for Babel, code blocks and literate
programming. I'm sure this section will get bigger as I'm getting
really into LP lately. It's one reason why I'm getting down with this
