* Move org/el/elc files out of the parent directory
This shouldn't be too hard.
I'll make a directory called 'lisp' and put it in the load path.
Then, add the starter-kit org files to the lisp directory.
Make sure that init.el knows to load from there.

* Makefile changes
Add a command to download and build the latest org-mode.
Add command to download and install cask.
Add command to tangle Cask config out of org file.
Add a command to run cask.

* running wishlist
  - go through sk files and pull out stuff i want
  - look at my existing configs and pull in stuff i want
  - everything should be organized in one file
